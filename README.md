# Enso OS

## Fork

This is a fork of https://github.com/Nick92/Enso-OS. The password focus seems to be lacking in the main repo, due to left-right arrow key user selection. Hence, I have implemented a simple hack to disable that, and enable password focus instead, as I only have a single user and feel that the focus is a more useful feature.


A simple OS designed for ease of use and ageing computers
